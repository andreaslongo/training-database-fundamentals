This repository contains the source code for my online course {url_site}.

It's built with {url_hugo}, a {url_static_site_generator}, and hosted on {url_github_pages}.

== Requirements

{url_hugo} must be installed alongside {url_asciidoctor} to build the site.

== Editing

I write my content in {url_asciidoc} format.

To get a live preview of the website, launch a local Hugo server:

[source]
----
$ hugo server
----

It will build and serve the site with Hugo's webserver.
The site gets automatically rebuild if you change a file.

Useful options:

- `--buildDrafts` to include content marked as draft
- `--buildFuture` to add content with publishdate in the future
- `--debug` for debugging output
- `--verbose` for verbose output

== Deployment

Deployment to {url_github_pages} happens automatically via {url_github_actions} when a new tag gets pushed to the repository.
